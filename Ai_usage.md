# AI Usage Notes

I used AI tools to accelerate development in the following ways:

- **ChatGPT**: generated initial retry + abort hook pattern and suggested a client-side image downscaling implementation. I adapted the suggested code for project constraints and TypeScript strict mode.
- **GitHub Copilot**: helped complete small boilerplate and some types generation.

All final code was reviewed and adapted manually to ensure correctness and meeting the assignment requirements.
